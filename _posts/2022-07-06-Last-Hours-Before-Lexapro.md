# Anxiety and Adult ADHD

The fourth of July has unceremoniously passed. Yesterday, I went to my healthcare provider for the first time since 2016. The short of it is that I haven't been responsible for myself for a very, very long time. Look, I'm new to this sort of thing and I've got a lot of insecurities in general. I've considered I might have anxiety issues for the last... four years, I suppose? I guess it's more like a lifelong thing that, untreated as it has been, has become almost completely unmanageable as a 32-year-old functional adult. Oh, yes--I do consider myself functional. Just not successful. I have a nice part-time job at $13.50 an hour, I have an associates degree in sysadmin, I pay my bills, I drive my own car, I buy a good chunk of the groceries and household goods and my use of the utilities. Hell, I bought my Starlink equipment and pay the bill for it so the entire household can benefit from the upgrade over HughesNet and enjoy Netflix and WFH. You don't realize what shit internet is unless you've never had a *good* internet service. In fact, let's utilize a cool markdown table to demonstrate, which is indicative of my recollection of these service connections.

| Provider  | Download                             | Upload                   | Ping        | Cap                                                      |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| DSL       | 1.5Mbps if you're lucky              | probably 500Kbps at best | 120ms       | There wasn't one, but if there was you'd never reach it. |
| HughesNet | 5Mbps--never reach advertised speeds | lol, it just won't       | Over 9000ms | 25GB                                                     |
| 4G LTE    | 15Mbps                               | 4Mbps                    | 70-120ms    | 30GB                                                     |
| Starlink  | 60-100Mbps                           | 5-12Mbps                 | 50-70ms     | Unlimited... for now                                     |

As you can see, I'm not going out of my way to suck Starlink's dick; I prefer to be realistic. I never see sub 50ms pings or 120Mbps+ down unless it's early morning or late evening. And realistically, because Elon Musk has always been a bait-and-switch bastard it most definitely *will* have caps eventually. That said, it's the best internet service I've ever had in my life.

I don't even really remember the point I was trying to make, I just got sidetracked by markdown tables and trying to prove some idea that most people don't realize their privilege of living in more urbanized areas where high speed broadband is available. I hate the city and prefer the quiet country, personally, so moving probably won't ever be an option.

It's hard to spell out my situation without being too personal; I don't want to do that. And I don't want sympathy or to hide behind anxiety as an excuse for my fuckups. Again, I consider myself at the very least a functional adult. If somebody blindfolded me and dropped me off in another state and said, *"welcome to your new life,"* I'd be fine. Assuming I wouldn't have to re-acquire ID's and the like. I mean to say, if you dropped me off in Arizona from Indiana with my wallet, driver's license and credit card, I could get home or start over. Well, not the Arizona desert (which I guess is basically just Arizona). Then I'd probably just die. Yikes!

So you probably wonder, as per the heading, what this has to do with Anxiety and Adult ADHD? Read this section again, and you'll get the joke. Sorry--dark humor.

### TL;DR
I basically went to my healthcare provider and took some notes with me. Some of them might be too personal to share (maybe I will in the future). I anticipated they would give me one of those stupid-ass litmus tests for anxiety and depression but my concern was that I was "*too functional*" to answer the questions in a way that aligned with their formulaic results. So here's a protip for other people looking for help with anxiety--be prepared; bring notes. You're not trying to game the test; you're trying to communicate with your doctor to get help.

Here's some of my sanitized examples:

#### Inability or slowness to positively adjust to changes in your environment

I'm going out on a limb now--if you fight change tooth and nail and can't adjust to it, you probably have anxiety. If, like me, you are unsettled by things as simple as furniture moved around, or the contents of drawers moved like forks or cooking accessories, you probably have anxiety. And I mean *unsettled*, not just a pissed off, annoyed *"god, I have to relearn the kitchen*" reaction. I mean a fundamental, fucked up worldview where you always knew where the cutlery was, and now this immutable constancy you always could count on is no longer real, and *you find yourself unable to positively adjust to this change in your life.*

#### Unwillingness to take on extra responsibility

Or, fear of failure. You like things staying the way they are, but then you realize there's a world of difference between 25 and 30.

#### Magpie-like tendencies

You don't throw shit away. I mean, you're probably not a hoarder in the literal respect *"you're not throwing literal garbage away.*" A chipped mug given to you by your grandmother? It's sentimental! Old rusty tools you keep saying you'll sand down and clean?

See, I use the excuse of saying I stand by the Marie Kondo method of only keeping the things which "*spark joy.*" The reality is that you're afraid to throw away something you think you're going to miss. And don't get me wrong; I've done this. I've thrown away college textbooks I once thought I wouldn't want anymore only to realize, "*damn, I wish I still had that bigass network book to reference.*"

#### You've probably had a panic attack, and didn't even know it.

There was a time in 2018 where I was setting up an online community for people from a web forum we all were part of that was closing down. I promised that I would have a migration path and fully functional community within 10 days of my announcement. And, if I remember right, I delivered on day 8. During this time, I was also facing an issue with my financial aid running out while my last few classes were closing left and right due to low enrollment. If **A)** this forum didn't have a successful launch and **B)** my financial aid ran out because I couldn't get my classes, I was fucked.

So, a panic attack is when you have really short, gasping breaths. You feel like you can't breathe; the reality is that you're hyperventilating. Your very airways feel like they're constricted by Death's cold hand as you're taking short, shuddering gasps of air while your heart rate climbs up to 200bpm. Your first one is your worst, because it literally feels like dying. It feels like you're going to asphyxiate, or your heart is going to give out. **It was actually a very long time before, in retrospect, I realized it was a panic attack.** I never told anybody this happened until I told my doctor yesterday.

#### Laziness and Lethargy as substitutes for motivation and productivity
This is the point where I start to question if my anxiety might be skewing closer towards mild depression. At some point I became convinced that because I was a manchild that I was still young. Because I felt young, because I still look like I'm in my 20's, I deluded myself into thinking there were infinite tomorrows. Always tomorrow to look for a better job. Always tomorrow to fix something about myself, life, or around the house. Always tomorrow to write. Always later to read. I can't even enjoy video games, TV, or movies; so much investment of attention and finite time. My favorite music genre has become vaporwave, music that is notoriously meant to be ambient, background tracks. Music designed to be nostalgia's refrain. Memory's leitmotif. A true to life Elegy of Emptiness that leaves you outside your own body to seek happier times.

The scary thing is, I don't even know where my time is going. I waste a lot of time not enjoying time. I nap a lot. I sleep a lot. I eat a lot. I hate exercise because it makes my body hurt. I hate socializing because I always have to put on my happy hat and, at a minimum, go to work. Go to the store. Drive around. Flash the same cheesy, shit-eating grin. Talk the same small talk, *"how 'bout those gas prices, eh?" "Supposed to get up to 90 tomorrow." "Sure could use some rain, right?*" Worst of all, my laugh has changed. It's... gross, and weird now. So manufactured and forced. I want to feel real again.

### Adult ADHD

It's basically been formalized, now, her diagnosis. She wants to try me on Escitalopram (Lexapro) for a few weeks and see if that helps with my concentration and attentiveness as well, since those problems can be exaggerated with anxiety. I keep joking about having *"Goldfish Memory,"* and I absolutely struggle with following linear instructions *"to-a-T."* My thoughts are very non-linear. Unfocused. College gave me structure, as did the methylphenidate that got me through most of those years until I stopped going to my doctor and my prescription for that ran out.

The worst part is that I remember what it used to feel like before these problems became unmanageable. I remember being able to think without incessant brain fog. I remember what it was like to be a leader. Being able to assess problems and find solutions. Being able to communicate what I wanted clearly. In as little as five years, it feels like I've gone from a natural, decisive leader and to a struggling, 32 year old manchild. I genuinely feel like my cognition is degrading. My confidence is shattered and not naturally reforming.

I can keep pushing, but I'm feeling more and more like there's little left to give.

Be functional.

I keep saying it. Put the happy hat on. Go to work. Pay your bills. Talk to strangers. I'm not special; we all have to do it. Nobody's special. It's the incessant lie we've been told by shows like Sesame Street, Reading Rainbow, and even the bible and "God's Plan for you." The reality is that we're all random; the chance that we were born, the chance that we live, was decided by our mother's menstrual cycles and whether your daddy decided to have a wank that night or not. Your life isn't special; but the consequences of your life are. It's your choices that matter. You don't have to be the fucking president, create vaccines for illnesses or go to space. If you look at all three of those things, remind yourself we live in a world where Donald Trump was president, people actively campaign against COVID-19 vaccines, and eternal memelord Elon Musk is leading the space race. Your choices could be choosing to be an electrician. Joining the military. Mentoring troubled youths. They can be as simple as choosing to be well.

I'm tired of not being well; I'm finally getting help.

I started composing this blog post probably around 1:30PM EST. I've had fun, just poking away off and on through day. It's 7:00PM, now. I've been to the pharmacy, already, and picked up my Escitalopram. The doc said to start with half a tablet everyday for 7 days, then to switch to a full tablet daily. I've opted to take it at 9:00PM, shortly before bed. So this long stream of conscious thought is, quite literally, my final hours before Lexapro. I want to temper my expectations, however. Medicine can only help so much; I, ultimately, have to be the changes I need.

I want to update this blog daily for as long as possible, documenting my adjustment to this new medication. There's something to be said about being so numb that looking over the side-effects just makes you shrug and say, *"whatever."*

I guess that's all for now; see you on the other side.
