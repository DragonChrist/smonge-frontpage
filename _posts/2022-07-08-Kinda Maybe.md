I think it's working. All day I've felt an overall sense of general apathy, and a weird feeling of being on cruise control. I don't know if that's because of the Lexapro, or a placebo effect of what I think I *should* be feeling from it. Again, this is 1 tablet taken across two days.

The more I think on it, the more I'm convinced that this isn't something I want to have for the rest of my life. The goal is clear: unfuck whatever remains of YTPMania, and get the fuck out of SSRI's ASAP. When I switched from cashiering to stocking, my life was great. I had never been more content. But lingering in the back of my mind, my abandonment of YTPMania gnaws at my illusory placidity.

I wonder, is this hesitance common in people starting SSRI's? How much of this is anxiety fighting like a cornered beast trying to convince my brain this isn't a good idea? Is it even a good idea to anthropomorphize something like anxiety, and treat it like an enemy? Again, I remember what I was like in college. Assertive, attentive. Decisive. I could memorize the names of everybody in a class to address them directly. I was healthier, busier, and more motivated back then.

So what am I trying to do? Convince myself that anxiety isn't a dysfunction; that it's a frame of mind? Here's my thought:

For the last 3 years, I've been living by a simple premise: I never do the things I don't want to do, and I only do the things I want. I thought that was what I wanted more than anything in life. I'm realizing, however, that I'm missing deadlines. I'm missing structure and projects. The grand irony is YTPMania gave me plenty of those things. However, I didn't have healthy ways of dealing with my problems. If I'm remembering right, this was around the same time I quit vaping when the vape shop by work closed up. Maybe it was partially the fault of nicotine withdrawal that I became less responsive to my problems.

Anyways, this general apathy is slightly sobering. I don't feel bad, but I don't feel good either. Is this what I have to look forward to once I go up to 10mg next week? Just... emotional numbness? This is wrong; human beings aren't wired for this. We're not supposed to be able to stop feeling at a flick of the switch.

This is really all I have for today. I don't think that's specifically because of the Lexapro beginning to work but more because in my previous posts I went off on tangents about YTPMania which I don't really have anything to add for now in that regard.
