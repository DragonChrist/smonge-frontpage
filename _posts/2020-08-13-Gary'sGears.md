Chapter 1
Gary's Gears

Gary Levine wiped his face with the back of his hand, smearing oil and grease across his sweaty forehead on a hot summer day. The fans were running full blast, four industrial fans. Two in front of the garage doors blowing in, two up in the catwalks of the garage blowing out through the skylights.

Gary felt the sweat on his back evaporating through his blue shirt tucked into his work jeans. He rubbed at his scratchy white stubble pondering about his son's imminent homecoming.

The year was 1977. Gary Levine's garage in downtown Muncie trapped heat snugly despite his optimal airflow and his theory of *"Heat rises; blow it out!"* A constant flow of air only slightly helped with the stifling heat of an Indiana summer, but for Gary this was just another day.

In the back of the garage he could hear the whine of pneumatics from a lift where Pablo was working. Pablo was a friend of his son Mark. A year Mark's junior, Pablo stayed behind while Mark went to Miami University over in Oxford, Ohio. Pablo was good with his hands and out-of-the-box thinking, and Mark followed in his older brother Bill's path towards a business degree.

At least, that was the original idea. Gary looked up at the clock above his office door, and licked his lips. He stepeed through the garage doors and out into the sunny parking lot. Mark would be there any moment.

Gary took his handkerchief from his pocket, wiping the sweat from his face again and cleaning off some of the muck his brow accumulated from a day doing oil changes, changing spark plugs and other general automotive repair.

Soon enough, Gary saw his son's '67 Nova turn onto the street, windows down and baseball being broadcasted loudly over the radio.

Mark parked his car, and after stopping the engine he stepped out of his car. He pushed the driver's seat forward and reached into the back, pulling out two duffel bags he then slung over his shoulder before slamming the door his car shut. It echoed on the quiet streets of downtown Muncie.

"Hey, Pop," Mark waved softly at his father with a stoic face.

"Hey, Marky. Good drive?" Gary grinned, shielding his eyes from the sun with a hand.

"Eh," Mark shrugged, and half-smiled at his dad. "Just good to be home, I guess. More than anything." He clapped a hand on his dad's shoulder as he walked past into the garage.

Mark went straight towards his father's office. It had a large window, the sill brimming with dust and a good humored "CLEAN ME!" writter in dust by his brother Bill years earlier.

Mark grasped the tarnished knob of the door, instinctively jerking up and to the left as he twisted it which pushed the door back enough into its hinge to open easily. Pop never changed. He wouldn't fix that door until it was off its hinges, Mark thought.

His father's office was small, just large enough to be called an office. It had a desk in it with lots of stacks of paper, empty diet Pepsi cans strewn about. There was also an ancient, green loveseat that permanently smelled liked sweat and engine grease. It was a home away from home to Mark and his father. Mark recalled many a night "camping" at the garage with his father after his mom passed.

His dad would work at the Delco-Remy battery plant during the day while Mark and Bill were at school, and fix cars dropped off for him at night. That often meant many "campouts" for Mark until he was old enough to be left alone at home. His father didn't know a good night's sleep in a proper bed for years, but Mark knew at the back of his head his father couldn't be reminded of an empty bed waiting for him at home. Sleeping on the couch at home, or at the garage, Gary Levine never slept more than small catnaps at a time. By the time Bill was in college and Mark was about to graduate from Central high school, his dad made the decision to buy a new, full-size mattress, leave Delco-Remy and start sleeping at home again.

Mark threw his luggage into the corner of the office and sank into the well worn cushions of the love seat, putting his feet up on the armrest and letting out a long sigh as he tipped his baseball cap forward and shut his eyes. Occasionally he'd open them and look up thoughtfully at the metal roof of the garage, his brain fried from a long hot trip he didn't want to make.

After a few minutes, he heard a rap on the office window, and heard the door being pushed open. His father stepped into the office, and sat down in his office chair with a bit of a groan and pained look.

"Ah, my legs, Marky," Gary laughed. He looked at his son warmly. He thought for a moment of what he wanted to say. Mark wasn't speaking. Gary cleared his throat. "Look, Mark," he began businesslike. "You're not the first person to drop out of college. It's not for everyone, and it's not the end of the world even if it feels like it to you right now."

"Wrong major," Mark mumbled dully under his breath.

"Doesn't matter," Gary sharply replied. "Now listen, son. I can give you some work. Just like the old days. Save up some cash for a few years and try again. Hell, go to Ball State like Billy did. Stay in town. Stay at home. Just pitch in around the house and you'll save money in the long run."

"Ha," Mark snorted, wistfully looking back up at the ceiling. "Ball State won't take a dropout like me."

"Then go to the I.V. Tech for a semester or two. Get your grades up and transfer."

Mark frowned, not meeting his father's gaze. He knew his father meant well. He always did. From all those sleepless nights in the garage to long days in a factory. Mark knew his father cared for his family.

"Hear from Bill lately?" Mark then asked, thinking about his brother. He looked at his father, who was leaning back in his chair scratching at his stubble again.

"Called collect last week. You know him," Gary said with a half-smile. Mark knew Bill had a tendency to stretch the truth.

"He's swimming in millions, I guess?" Mark asked.

"He's got a hundred bucks if he says he has ten-thousand. That's why I'm worried, Mark. He didn't sound so good on the phone, and said he had a couple of hundred bucks and between businesses."

"So broke and unemployed, then."

"I'm worried, Marky," Gary reiterated firmly. "It's not as hard as it used to be, y'know? I offered to wire him some cash and he refused. That's a Levine for you, though."

Bill had graduated from Ball State the same year Mark left to Ohio to go to college. Bill went out to Boston with his best friends, trying to be hotshot entrepeneurs. Mark was anxioius to leave home back then too. He just left too soon.

Gary stood from his chair and stretched. His old back popped and again he groaned in discomfort. "Well, I'm getting some burgers from the McDonalds for lunch. Want any?"

"Nah," Mark shook his head. "I ate on the road, but thanks. I really just want to take a bit of a catnap.

"Goin' home?"

"Nah, I'll stay here."

Mark relaxed on the couch as his father left, playfully slapping Mark's shoes on the armrest as he left for lunch. Mark fell into a light sleep quickly from the warmth of the garage. As he napped, he dreamed of open roads stretching from horizon to horizon. Driving along, alone. Engine roaring and canopy down. No worries, no stress. No cares.

Mark turned in his sleep, feeling the crinkle of a magazine in the crevice between the cushion and armrest he was resting his head on. It was enough to disturb his nap. He leaned up, reched in between the cushion and pulled the magazine free.

It was an older issue of Popular Electronics. Mark smiled. The mailing label on it bore his name and address. His father clearly had been bringing Mark's magazines to the garage and reading them while Mark was away.

Mark had more than a passing interest in electronics when he got into high school. It's a wonder he went to college to attempt a business degree when he had such a knack for fixing small electronics. Growing up in his dad's garage contributed to that fact as he learned to fix his own problems rather than taking them to somebody else.

Mark flipped idly through the magazine, and stopped at an ad for something that had caught his interest while he was at college. The ad was for a home and hobbyist microcomputer kit, the Altair 8800.

The previous year at college Mark had met another student who had a fully loaded MITS Altair 8800 hooked up to a teletype machine. It ran the BASIC interpreter made by Bill Gates and Paul Allen at their fledgeling Micro-Soft company.

The student had demonstrated the microcomputer to Mark by loading the TTY with paper tape rolls which executed the BASIC programs the student had written.

Mark had been enamored with the machine, constantly borrowing his friend's BASIC manuals and learning more about computers and programming. He had actually spent so much time enthusing over the machines that when he should have been studying for exams, he spent his nights reading computer books trying to learn what he could without access to real hardware.

The Altair wasn't terribly expensive for a hobbyist, but for a student living on instant noodles and peanut butter it was quite a bit out of his reach even while fixing other students cars and electronics on the side for cash flow.

What Mark wanted was to understand microcomputers and how they worked. It wasn't like changing radio and TV tubes where the hardware simple did what it did. There was some intangible, electrical force inside circuit boards and chips that worked, as far as Mark understood, like magic.

Turning a few pages he saw another article, **"In's and Out's of Computer for Beginners."** He grinned, and started reading it. IIt was a lengthy article he had to re-read several times and he found himself lost in a world of memory registers and 8008 assembly.

Shortly after, Mark's dad came back to the office with a cold diet-Pepsi and checked in with him.

"You should go home, Mark. Hottest day of the summer so far. Pablo and I are gonna wrap it up soon."

Mark put the magazine down and stretched. "If you don't mind, Pop, I kinda just want to camp out here for the night. I know it sounds strange, but I'm not really ready to go home yet." His eyes darted towards his duffel bags. He saw his dad glance at them too, who looked back and nodded.

"I think I understand, Mark." Gary rubbed at his stubble again. "Come home when you're ready. I'll leave a light on just in case you change your mind."

"Thanks, dad." Mark then smiled, for what Gary would have noticed as the first time his son did since he got home. "If I'm not up in the morning, wake me up when you get here. And we'll get to work. Just like the old days, eh? Sound good?"

"Sounds good," Gary grinned back at Mark. "Seeya in the morning, Marky.
