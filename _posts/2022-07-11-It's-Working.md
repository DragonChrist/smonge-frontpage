I haven't updated the blog for a few days, but that's because I mostly had nothing to report and nothing to say.

Here I am, day 5 on Lexapro. Still on the 5mg, but by Thursday night, I'll be up to 10mg. I do find myself less bothered by some things. Tasks I would otherwise classify as a chore or unappealing are basically just *meh* now. Yesterday, however, I did find myself feeling a twinge of an anxiety attack while I was driving to work. I don't know what triggered it apart from wondering if my medication was actually helping or not. I'd guess that, as I'm very comfortable driving. I've been driving since 2009, and it has never triggered my anxiety. I've seen a lot of people claim that it gives them issues. I wonder if this is because when I learned how to drive, it was back before I knew what anxiety was. The 2000s were a different time. I think we try to imagine them as being super progressive and forward-thinking. Still, I don't really remember it as such. I loved the 2000s, don't get me wrong. But our slang was a lot more colorful back then, and there still wasn't a lot of understanding regarding things like depression and anxiety. We used to equate depression with sadness, anxiety with being a pussy, and that you had to *"cheer up,*" or "*man up*" and get over yourself.

To an extent, I still sort of think in those regards. It takes monumental effort, but changing your frame of mind goes a long way. I feel strongly that if you're still on the minor end of anxiety, like myself, some lifestyle changes will go a long way to overcoming it. I, in no way, classify my anxiety as major, but it's snowballed over five years. I don't want to take this shit for the rest of my life; no way. Then again, I also know people who are so overwhelmed with their anxiety and depression that permanent medication is the only thing that keeps them functional.

Yesterday, before work, I was planning out some bike routes on Google Maps. I don't cycle; I haven't in years. I mean, I have a bike; I might ride it up the road once a week to collect neighbors' trash bins for them, but I don't just go riding. I don't have a helmet, for one thing. At the very least, I want a helmet and reflective vest before I ride my bike around our rural area.

Again, I live in the country. Sometimes I wonder if people get confused by that word choice. I live in the United States, a country. But I live in rural Indiana (which, btw, is basically all of Indiana). I've been afforded a very privileged life where cycling isn't my mode of transportation but my leisure and exercise. And I *never* do it. Wonderfully open, very light traffic, highly scenic country roads rife for cycling, and still enough 4g to use Google Maps.

I need more exercise in general. I won't pretend to understand biochemistry, but something something *endorphins,* *browse /fit/* and *lift heavy shit,* aye?

The last thing of note is that I have been PM'd on Reddit by an old friend from the YTP community. I... haven't read it yet. I'm frankly surprised; I thought it was impossible to PM me on Reddit the way I have my profile settings. I do intend to. I think they are trying to do what I did for them a looooonnnng ass time ago; I can't disrespect their effort to try to reach through to me. I owe them that. As a friend, and because they tried like I did many years ago for them.
